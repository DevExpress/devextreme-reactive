* **react-grid:** switch to column extensions in TableGroupRow ([#609](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/issues/609)) ([373d4d8](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/commit/373d4d8))


### Features

* **react-grid:** add the ColumnChooser plugin ([#607](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/issues/607)) ([16eb588](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/commit/16eb588))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **react-grid:** We have moved the PagingState plugin's `totalCount` property to the CustomPaging plugin to improve API consistency. Now, you can add the CustomPaging plugin to a project and specify its `totalCount` property to implement remote paging.

  Before:

  ```js
  <Grid>
    <...>
    <PagingState totalCount={10} />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  <Grid>
    <...>
    <PagingState />
    <CustomPaging totalCount={10} />
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** To simplify working and make consistent API, some plugins properties have been renamed.
  - The TableHeaderRow plugin's `allowGroupingByClick` property has been renamed to `showGroupingControls`.
  - The GroupingPanel plugin's `allowUngroupingByClick` property has been renamed to `showGroupingControls`.
  - The PagingPanel plugin's `allowedPageSizes` property has been renamed to `pageSizes `.
* **react-grid:** A column's `getCellValue` function has gotten higher priority than that defined in the Grid component.
* **react-grid:** The `createRowChange` function arguments order has been changed to `(row: any, value: any, columnName: string)` to improve the API consistency. Now, the EditingState plugin's `createRowChange` function has the same signature as the column extension's one.
* **react-grid:** We have renamed the following plugins that process data to make the Grid API more consistent:

  - LocalFiltering => IntegratedFiltering
  - LocalGrouping => IntegratedGrouping
  - LocalPaging => IntegratedPaging
  - LocalSelection => IntegratedSelection
  - LocalSorting => IntegratedSorting
* **react-grid:** We removed the LocalSorting plugin's `getColumnIdentity` property to improve API consistency. Now, use the column extension's `criteria` property to specify an individual column's grouping criteria.

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns = [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const fieldGroupCriteria = /* custom group criteria */;
  const getColumnIdentity = (columnName) => {
    if (name === 'field') return fieldGroupCriteria;
  };

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <LocalGrouping getColumnIdentity={getColumnIdentity} />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const fieldGroupCriteria = /* custom group criteria */;
  const integratedGroupingColumnExtensions = [
    { columnName: 'field', criteria: fieldGroupCriteria },
  ];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <IntegratedGrouping columnExtensions={integratedGroupingColumnExtensions} />
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** We removed the `cancel` argument from the SortingState plugin's `setColumnSorting` action and from the `onSort` event of the TableHeaderCellProps and GroupPanelItemProps component properties. Now, you can pass `null` to the `direction` argument to cancel sorting by column.
* **react-grid:** The TableHeaderCellProps interface's `allowResizing` property has been renamed to `resizingEnabled` to improve the API consistency.
* **react-grid:** We removed the `getColumnCompare` property from the LocalSorting plugin to improve API consistency. Now, use the `columnExtension` property to specify individual column sorting options.

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns = [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const fieldCompare = /* custom sort compare */;
  const getColumnCompare = (columnName) => {
    if (name === 'field') return fieldCompare;
  };

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <LocalSorting getColumnCompare={getColumnCompare} />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const fieldCompare = /* custom sort compare */;
  const integratedSortingColumnExtensions = [
    { columnName: 'field', compare: fieldIdentity },
  ];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <IntegratedSorting columnExtensions={integratedSortingColumnExtensions} />
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** We have integrated the column chooser into the Grid as a plugin to simplify the API. Now, use the column chooser as follows:

  ```js
  <Grid>
    {/* ... */}
    <TableColumnVisibility
      /* props */
    />
    <Toolbar />
    <ColumnChooser />
  </Grid>
  ```

  For details, see [Controlling Column Visibility](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/column-visibility/).
* **react-grid:** We extracted the column's `showWhenGrouped` property that the TableGroupRow plugin handles to a column extension to improve the API readability.
  The TableGroupRow plugin's `showColumnsWhenGrouped` property type has been changed to `boolean` and this property affects all columns. If you need to control specific columns' visibility, use column extensions.

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns = [{ name: 'field', showWhenGrouped: true }, { name: 'field2' }];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <TableGroupRow />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const tableGroupColumnExtensions = [
    { columnName: 'field', showWhenGrouped: true },
  ];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <TableGroupRow columnExtensions={tableGroupColumnExtensions} />
  </Grid>
  ```

  Note that column extension properties have higher priority than corresponding plugin properties.
* **react-grid:** We renamed the `DragDropContext` plugin to `DragDropProvider` to improve API consistency.
* **react-grid:** We removed the `allowResizing` property from the TableHeaderRow plugin to simplify the API. Now, adding the TableColumnResizing plugin enables column resizing.
* **react-grid:** In order to improve API readability, we extracted the `width` and `align` column properties that the Table and VirtualTable plugins handle into a separate property. Now, the `width` and `align` properties in the Grid `columns` are no longer supported. Use a TableColumnExtension instead:

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field', width: 100 }, { name: 'field2' }];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <Table />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field1' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const tableColumnExtensions = [{ columnName: 'field1', width: 100 }];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <Table columnExtensions={tableColumnExtensions} />
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** In order to simplify API, we changed the way the DataTypeProvider plugin detects columns associated with a type. Now, to associate a custom formatter and editor with a column, pass a column array to the DataTypeProvider's `for` field:

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field', dataType: 'boolean' }, { name: 'field2' }];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <DataTypeProvider type="boolean" />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field1' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const booleanColumns = ['field1'];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <DataTypeProvider for={booleanColumns} />
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** In order to improve API consistency, we've decided to replace the `getColumnPredicate` function in the LocalFiltering plugin with the LocalFilteringColumnExtension.

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns = [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const fieldPredicate = /* custom filtering predicate */;
  const getColumnPredicate = (columnName) => {
    if (name === 'field') return fieldPredicate;
  };

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <LocalFiltering getColumnPredicate={getColumnPredicate} />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const fieldPredicate = /* custom filtering predicate */;
  const integratedFilteringColumnExtensions = [
    { columnName: 'field', predicate: fieldPredicate },
  ];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <IntegratedFiltering columnExtensions={integratedFilteringColumnExtensions} />
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** In order to simplify API, we've decided to remove allowDragging properties in TableHeaderRow and GroupingPanel plugins. Now, to enable dragging it is enough to add the DragDropContext plugin.
* **react-grid:**  
To provide a more convenient and flexible way to render elements that are placed within a Grid header we add the Toolbar plugin. For this reason, the GroupingPanel plugin has the Toolbar dependency:
 
  ```js
  import {
    // ...
    Toolbar,
    GroupingPanel
  } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid-material-ui';

  <Grid>
    {/* ... */}
    <Toolbar />
    <GroupingPanel />
  </Grid>
  ```
   
  To simplify Grid's markup we removed header placeholder and footer placeholder components.
  If you're customizing Grid appearance using the `headerPlaceholderComponent` and `footerPlaceholderComponent` properties, your code should be updated as follows:
   
  Before:

  ```js
  <Grid
    headerPlaceholderTemplate={() => (<div />)}
    footerPlaceholderTemplate={() => (<div />)}
  >
  {/* ... */}
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  import { Template, TemplatePlaceholder } from '@devexpress/dx-react-core';

  <Grid>
    <Template name="header">
      <TemplatePlaceholder />
      {/* Custom markup */}
    </Template>
    <Template name="footer">
      <TemplatePlaceholder />
      {/* Custom markup */}
    </Template>
    {/* ... */}
  </Grid>
  ```
* **react-grid:** We extracted the column's `createRowChange` property that the EditingState plugin handles to a column extension to improve API readability.

  Before:

  ```js
  const columns = [{ name: 'field', createRowChange: (row, value) => { /* logic */ } }, { name: 'field2' }];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <EditingState />
  </Grid>
  ```

  After:

  ```js
  const columns= [{ name: 'field' }, { name: 'field2' }];
  const editingColumnExtensions = [
    { columnName: 'field', createRowChange: (row, value) => { /* logic */ } },
  ];

  <Grid columns={columns}>
    <EditingState columnExtensions={editingColumnExtensions} />
  </Grid>
  ```

  Note that column extension properties have higher priority than corresponding plugin properties.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **react-core:** To get rid of redundant 'div' elements in markup, we have updated the minimum React version the grid requires to 16.2.0.
* **react-grid:** Some times ago, we created a [pull request](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/pull/179) that allows using our React Grid with the [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable) library. The main change is that we switched from the `Array.prototype.slice()` function to the `Array.from()` one to copy arrays. It was not a good decision, because `Array.from()` is [slower](https://jsperf.com/array-from-vs-array-slice) than `Array.prototype.slice()`. Now we return back to `Array.prototype.slice()` for performance reasons.

  If you are using the seamless-immutable library, change your code as follows:

  ```js
  const state = {
    data: Immutable({
      selection: [],
    })
  };

  <Grid>
    { /* ...*/ }
    <SelectionState
      // selection: this.state.data.selection -> before
      selection: this.state.data.selection.asMutable() // now
    />
  </Grid>
  ```
  The related [guide](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/immutable-data/) is updated as well.
* **react-grid-material-ui:** To make Grid for Material UI more flexible we've stopped using the [Paper](https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com/demos/paper/) component inside the Grid's layout.
 
It allows placing our Grid to an existing Paper with other components. For example:

  ```js
  <Paper>
    <Button>Products</Button>
    <Button>Customers</Button>
    <Button>Sales</Button>
    <Grid
      /* ... */
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </Grid>
  </Paper>
  ```

* **react-grid:** To simplify working with selection features and make the selection plugin's purposes clearer, the functionality that computes the selection state has been moved from the `SelectionState` plugin to the `LocalSelection` one:
  * The `availableToSelect` getter has been deleted from the `SelectionState` plugin, while the `selectAllAvailable`, `allSelected`, and `someSelected` getters have been added to the `LocalSelection` plugin.
  * The `SelectionState` plugin's `setRowsSelection` action has been renamed to `toggleSelection`.
  * The `selection` getter's return value type has been changed to `Set`.
  * The default value of the `TableSelection` plugin's `showSelectAll` property has been changed to `false`.

  Both plugins are available from the `@devexpress/dx-react-grid` package.
  Note that `LocalSelection` should be linked after `SelectionState` if you use the `TableSelection` plugin.
* **react-core:** To simplify working with plugins, we have got rid of the Watcher.
Now, you can use a Getter instead.

  Before:
  ```
  ...
  <Watcher
    watch={
      getter = getter('someGetter')
    }
    onChange={(action, someGetter) => {
      action('someAction')(someGetter);
    }}
  />
  ...
  ```

  After:
  ```
  ...
  <Getter
    name="someGetter"
    computed={(getters, actions) => {
        actions.someAction(getters.someGetter);
      return getters.someGetter;
    }}
  />
  ...
  ```

* **react-grid:** Such plugin names as `TableView` and `VirtualTableView` don't correspond to other plugins like `TableFilterRow`, `TableGroupRow`, `TableSelection`, which do not have "view" in their names. To keep the names of plugins consistent, the following changes have been introduced:

  * the `TableView` plugin has been renamed to `Table`;
  * the `VirtualTableView` plugin has been renamed to `VirtualTable`;

* **react-grid:** The TableEditRow plugin's `editCellTemplate`, and `editRowTemplate` properties have been replaced with `cellComponent`, and `rowComponent` ones, which accept components instead of render functions. Find more details here: [#496](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/issues/496)
* **react-grid:** The GroupingPanel plugin's `groupPanelTemplate`, and `groupPanelItemTemplate` properties have been replaced with  `containerComponent`, and `itemComponent` ones, which accept components instead of render functions. Find more details here: [#496](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/issues/496)

  `containerComponent` takes on the `children` property instead of all arguments passed to the `groupPanelTemplate` function.

  The `onSort`, and `onGroup` properties passed to `itemComponent` are used instead of the `changeSortingDirection`, and `groupByColumn` arguments passed to the `groupPanelItemTemplate` function. The `item`, and `draft` properties are no longer available, use the `item` property instead.
* **react-grid:** The TableEditColumn plugin's `commandTemplate`, `cellTemplate` and `headingCellTemplate` properties have been replaced with `commandComponent`, `cellComponent`, and `headerCellComponent` ones, which accept components instead of render functions. Find more details here: [#496](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/issues/496)

  Properties passed to a component returned from `commandComponent` have the same names as arguments passed to the `commandTemplate` function with the following exception. The `onExecute` property is used instead of the `executeCommand` argument.

  All properties passed to the `cellComponent` except `row` have been replaced by the `children` property providing configured commands.

  All properties passed to the `headingCellComponent` have been replaced by the `children` property providing configured commands.
* **react-grid:** The TableGroupRow plugin's `groupIndentColumnWidth` property has been renamed to `indentColumnWidth`. The `groupCellTemplate`, `groupRowTemplate` and `groupIndentCellTemplate` properties have been replaced with `cellComponent`, `rowComponent`, and `indentCellComponent` ones, which accept components instead of render functions.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **rect-grid:** The `ColumnOrderState` plugin has been renamed to `TableColumnReordering` and is now available via the `@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3` and `@devexpress/dx-react-grid-material-ui` packages.

  The `TableView` plugin's `allowColumnReordering` property has been removed and the `TableColumnReordering` plugin now depends on the `TableView` plugin. Thus, it is enough to link the `TableColumnReordering` plugin below the `TableView` plugin to enable column reordering.

  Before:
  ```jsx
  import {
    // ...
    ColumnOrderState
  } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid';

  // ...

  <ColumnOrderState defaultOrder={[/* ... */]} />
  <TableView allowColumnReordering />
  ```

  After:
  ```jsx
  import {
    // ...
    TableColumnReordering
  } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3';
  // } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid-material-ui';

  // ...

  <TableView />
  <TableColumnReordering defaultOrder={[/* ... */]} />
  ```
* **react-grid:** The TableColumnResizing plugin is now available in the "@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3" and "@devexpress/dx-react-grid-material-ui" packages.

  Use the following code to import the plugin.

  ```
  import {
    TableColumnResizing,
  } from from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3'/* or '@devexpress/dx-react-grid-material-ui' */;
  ```

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **react-grid:** The `scope` parameter of the `setColumnSorting` action has been removed.

  The `GroupingState` plugin now has an optional dependency on the `SortingState` plugin. So, `GroupingState` should be placed after `SortingState`.

  Before:

  ```jsx
  <GroupingState /* ... */ />
  <SortingState /* ... */ />
  ```

  After:

  ```jsx
  <SortingState /* ... */ />
  <GroupingState /* ... */ />

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **react-grid:**
The following changes have been made in the GroupingPanel plugin:
  - the `groupPanelCellTemplate` property has been renamed to `groupPanelItemTemplate`;
  - the `groupedColumns` property has been renamed to `groupingPanelItems` and now contains an array of objects which conform the GroupingPanelItem interface.

  The `isDraft` property of the DraftGrouping interface has been renamed to `draft`.
* **react-grid:**  
In order to reduce API verbosity, the `groupedColumns` and `draftGroupedColumns` getters are no longer exported from the GroupingState plugin.
 
The `column` field is no longer present in the GroupRow interface. So, to access the `column` field in groupCellTemplate and groupIndentCellTemplate of the TableGroupRow plugin, it is necessary to use `args.column` instead of `args.row.column`.
* **react-grid:** The `colspan` field passed to tableNoDataCellTemplate (the TableView plugin), detailCellTemplate (the TableRowDetail plugin) and groupCellTemplate (the TableGroupRow plugin) has been renamed to `colSpan`.
* **react-grid:** To simplify the Grid plugins API the `setRowSelection` action was removed from the `SelectionState` and `TableSelection` plugins.

  For now, to select a single row you can use the `setRowsSelection`  action in the following manner:

    ```js
    setRowsSelection({ rowIds: [/* rowId */] })
    ```
* **react-grid:**  
`TableRow` and `TableColumn` interfaces structure has been changed. Now, it wraps original rows and columns of the Grid component instead of patching it.

  Before:

  ```ts
  interface TableRow extends Row {
    type?: string;
  }
  interface TableColumn extends Column {
    type?: string;
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  interface TableRow {
    key: string;
    type: string;
    rowId?: number | string;
    row?: Row;
    height?: number;
  }
  interface TableColumn {
    key: string;
    type: string;
    column?: Column;
    width?: number;
  }
  ```

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **react-grid:** We moved layout templates from the TableView plugin to the Grid component. The Grid component with the predefined plugins is now available in the "@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3" package. If you want to define custom layout templates, the Grid component without predefined templates is still available in the "devexpress/dx-react-grid" package.

  The following code:

  ```jsx
  import {
    Grid
  } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid';
  ```

  should be replaced with:

  ```jsx
  import {
    Grid

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Previously, to enable the 'Detail row' feature a user had to use only the 'TableRowDetail' plugin. But, this plugin mixed up the rendering and state managing functionality. Now, there are two particular plugins. The first one is the 'RowDetailState' plugin. It's responsible for a state managing. The second one is the 'TableRowDetail' plugin. It only renders a detail row.

  The following code:

  ```jsx
  <TableRowDetail
    expandedRows={expandedRows}
    onExpandedRowsChange={onExpandedRowsChange}
    template={({ row }) =>
      <GridDetailContainer
        data={row}
        columns={detailColumns}
      />
    }
  />
  ```

  should be replaced with:

  ```jsx
  <RowDetailState
    expandedRows={expandedRows}
    onExpandedRowsChange={onExpandedRowsChange}
  />
  <TableRowDetail
    template={({ row }) =>
      <GridDetailContainer
        data={row}
        columns={detailColumns}
      />
    }
  />
