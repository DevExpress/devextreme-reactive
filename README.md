# DevExtreme Reactive &middot; [![Build](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/actions/workflows/ci_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/actions/workflows/ci_tests.yml) [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@devexpress/dx-core.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devexpress/dx-core)

DevExtreme Reactive is a set of business React components that deeply integrate with Bootstrap and Material-UI libraries.

## :warning: DevExtreme Reactive Components - Maintenance Support Mode
DevExtreme Reactive component libraries are in maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to DevExtreme Reactive component libraries in the future (end-of-life: December 2025).

**Developing a React App? Check out our updated React UI Suite instead**
If you are considering React for an upcoming software project or have used DevExtreme Reactive components in the past, please visit [js.devexpress.com/react](https://js.devexpress.com/React/) and download a free trial version of DevExtreme React UI – over 70+ components designed to help you build your best, without limits or compromise.

### Why DevExtreme Reactive is now in maintenance support mode?
DevExtreme Reactive began as an alternative to the main DevExtreme product line with the following objectives:  
* Provide fully native components for Angular, React, and Vue. Reduce maintenance costs due to a shared codebase.  
* Offer users of popular open-source UI suites such as Bootstrap, Vuetify, and MUI a set of rich components (DataGrid, Scheduler, Charts).  
* Introduce more flexibility via a comprehensive API and built-in plugin system.
  
Since the original release of DevExtreme Reactive, we reached the following conclusions:  
* Of all our product suites, only the React line (with MUI integration) generated user interest. That market trend forced us to terminate our Reactive Angular and Reactive Vue produce lines.  
* Due to the popularity of DevExtreme Reactive components for MUI, MUI chose to launch their own set of UI components.  
* Based on research, we discovered that developers preferred out-of-the-box solutions versus writing highly customizable code manually. Accordingly, most opted to use React UI components shipping in our main DevExtreme product library.

At present, we must maintain two competitive product lines in parallel - using resources that could be better spent delivering additional value for our primary JS/TS product line ([js.devexpress.com/react](https://js.devexpress.com/React/)).

### What does maintenance support mode mean for you?
* Continued Support: We will continue to provide DevExtreme Reactive support to those with an active DevExpress subscription (until the end-of–life: December 2025).  
* Migration Resources: Our goal is to help DevExtreme Reactive users migrate to [DevExtreme React](https://js.devexpress.com/React/). We are preparing guides to help with this transition. These guides will be available on our website when we release v24.2 (mid-December 2024). Please see the timeline below for additional information in this regard. 

### Timeline
* With our v24.1 release, our Reactive product line moved to maintenance mode. We will no longer develop/deliver new functionality. 
* Once v24.2 ships (mid-December 2024), we will prepare and publish basic migration/transition guides (from the Reactive line to our [DevExtreme React](https://js.devexpress.com/React/) product suite). While we cannot address all usage scenarios within these guides (because product feature sets do not fully overlap), we will do our best to document solutions for all basic use cases.  
* Post v24.2 release, our Reactive line will be deprecated.  
* We will continue to support the Reactive line and its users for two more release cycles (v25.1 and v25.2). This should give everyone enough time to transition away from Reactive to DevExtreme React. End of life for our Reactive product line will be announced prior to the release of v25.2 (mid-December 2025).

We appreciate your understanding and support during this transition period.  If you have questions or need assistance during transition, please submit a support ticket via the [DevExpress Support Center](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Create). We will be happy to follow up.
