# React Core - PluginContainer

[PluginContainer](../reference/plugin-container.md) is an auxilary React component created to hold several plugin primitives at the same level of the React component tree. It should be used inside plugins as a root node containing plugin primitives. The main purpose of the component is to help identify positions of plugin primitives.
