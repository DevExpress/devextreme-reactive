# React Chart - Animation

You can add the [Animation](../reference/animation.md) plugin to the Chart component to animate all its series at the beginning of the lifetime. If you need to modify animation options, implement a custom point component for a series. In the following example, animation duration is configured individually for each bar:

.embedded-demo({ "path": "chart-basic/animation", "showThemeSelector": true })
