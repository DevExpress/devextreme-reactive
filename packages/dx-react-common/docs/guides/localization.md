# React Components - Localization

This article describes how to localize UI texts in DevExtreme React Components.

## The "Messages" Property

Plugins that render UI texts have the `messages` property. It accepts an object that contains messages as key-value pairs in which keys are message IDs and values are messages. For a list of supported message IDs, see the Localization Messages section of the plugin's API Reference.

To translate a message, find the plugin that renders it and specify the plugin's `messages` property with an object that contains your translations. Those message IDs that you omit from the object use default translations.

The following code translates a message from the `Table` plugin:

```jsx
const tableMessages = {
  noData: 'Keine Daten verf√ºgbar',
};
...
<Table messages={tableMessages}>
```

## Custom Message IDs

In some cases, components allow you to use custom message IDs. For example, in the React Grid component, custom filter operation names are used as message IDs to retrieve texts for filter selector items:

```jsx
<DataTypeProvider
  for={dateColumns}
  availableFilterOperations={['month', ...]}
/>
<TableFilterRow
  messages={ { month: 'Month equals' } }
/>
```
The complete code is available in the [Custom Filter Operations](../../../../grid/docs/guides/filtering/#custom-filter-operations) article.

## Placeholders

Messages can contain texts in curly braces. These are placeholders used to display dynamic values. For example, the `PagingPanel` plugin's `info` message contains three placeholders:

```jsx
const pagingMessages = {
  info: '${from}-${to} of ${count}',
};
```
They are replaced with actual data when the plugin is rendered.
