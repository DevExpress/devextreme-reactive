# React Grid Uncontrolled State Mode

This demo shows the Grid capability to manage its UI state internally. This mode is usefull if you do not need to use the Grid state in other parts of your application. Also, it can be useful if you are just prototyping your application and do not want to spend time on learning what this state consists of. If you just need to display your data and analyse it using Grid features, such as sorting, grouping, filtering, etc., you will also find the uncontrolled state mode helpful.
