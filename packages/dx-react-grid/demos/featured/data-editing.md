# React Grid Data Editing

This demo shows the Grid's editing and customization capabilities in the [Controlled State mode](../../docs/guides/controlled-and-uncontrolled-modes.md). In the controlled state mode, the whole Grid functionality or its part is controlled externally. In the first case, the Grid works as a stateless component. Use the Controlled State mode when you need to share the Grid's state between other application parts. It also allows you to persist the Grid's state and restore it when required.

You can display custom data types using the `DataTypeProvider` plugin. It is also possible to render a custom component instead of the integrated one.
