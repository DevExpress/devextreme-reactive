# React Chart - Animation

You can add the [Animation](../reference/animation.md) plugin to the Chart component to animate all the series when they first appear on-screen. To modify animation options, implement a custom point component for a series. In the following example, the duration of each bar's animation is configured individually:

.embedded-demo({ "path": "chart-basic/animation", "showThemeSelector": true })
