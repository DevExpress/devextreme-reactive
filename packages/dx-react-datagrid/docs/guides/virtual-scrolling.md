# DataGrid Virtual Scrolling

## Overview

The DataGrid component can handle a large amount of data passed to it. In some cases it may be required to show 10 000 rows or even 1 000 000 ones. As an alternative to paging with hundreds or thousands or pages there is virtual mode for data presentation.

## Plugin List

There are no plugins that implement virtual scrolling. It is designed as an alternative to the ordinary table template for the [TableView](table-view.md) plugin.

## Basic Setup

The following example demonstrates the basic DataGrid with virtual scrolling setup:
