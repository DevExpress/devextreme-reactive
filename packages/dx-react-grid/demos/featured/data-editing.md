# React Grid Data Editing

This demo shows the Grid's editing and customization capabilities in the [Controlled mode](../../docs/guides/controlled-and-uncontrolled-modes.md). Use this mode when you need to share the Grid's state between other application parts. It also allows you to persist the Grid's state and restore it when required.

In this demo, custom data types are displayed using the `DataTypeProvider` plugin. See [Data Formatting](../../docs/guides/data-formatting.md)
