**Controlled state mode**

You can fully control Data Grid state treating it as a pure view component. Easily enable state persistence and time-traveling with no side-effects.

**Uncontrolled state mode**

Data Grid can manage its state internally helping you to write less code and focus on the tasks that are really important at the current stage.
