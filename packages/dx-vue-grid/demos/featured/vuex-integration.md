# Vue Grid Vuex Integration

In this demo, the Grid state is managed by the [Vuex store](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/getting-started.html). All end-user actions that modify the component state produce corresponding [Vuex mutations](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/mutations.html) the Grid commits. The [Vue DevTool Extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) is activated in this demo, which allows you to perform time-traveling and observe Grid state changes.
