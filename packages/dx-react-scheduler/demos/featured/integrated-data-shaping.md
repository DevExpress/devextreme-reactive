# React Scheduler Integrated Data Shaping

This demo shows how to use TypeScript to create a Scheduler with [date navigation](../../docs/guides/date-navigation.md) and [view switching](../../docs/guides/view-switching.md) in Uncontrolled mode. Use this mode if you do not need to share the Schedulerâ€™s state with other parts of your application.
