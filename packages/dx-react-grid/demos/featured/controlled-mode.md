# React Grid Controlled State Mode

This demo shows the Grid capability to delegate its UI state management to the parent component. You can contol either the whole Grid state or just a part of it. In the
first case, Grid becomes a stateless component. This mode is usefull if you need to use the Grid state in other parts of your application. Using this mode, you can also persist the component state and restore it when required.
