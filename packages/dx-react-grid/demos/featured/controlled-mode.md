# React Grid Controlled State Mode

This demo demonstrates the use of the Grid in the [Controlled State mode](/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/controlled-and-uncontrolled-modes/). That is the parent component manages the whole Grid's state or just its part. In the first case, the Grid works as a stateless component. Use the Controlled State mode when you need to share the Grid's state among other application parts. It also allows you to persist the Grid's state and restore it when required.
