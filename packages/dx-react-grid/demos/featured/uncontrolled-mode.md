# React Grid Uncontrolled State Mode

This demo demonstrates the Grid's functionality in the [Uncontrolled State mode](../../docs/guides/controlled-and-uncontrolled-modes.md). That is, the Grid mananges its state internally. Use this mode if you do not need to share the Grid's state among other parts of your application.
