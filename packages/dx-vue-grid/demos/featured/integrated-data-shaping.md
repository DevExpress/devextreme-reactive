# Vue Grid Integrated Data Shaping

This demo shows the Grid's integrated sorting, grouping, filtering and paging capabilities. 

If you use selection with integrated data shaping, the way the Select All checkbox works depends on the plugin order. In this demo, the `dx-integrated-selection` plugin is linked after all the data shaping plugins. In this case, Select All affects only the displayed rows.
