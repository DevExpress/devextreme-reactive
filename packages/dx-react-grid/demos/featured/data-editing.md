# React Grid Data Editing

This demo shows how to edit and customize the Grid's data in the  [Controlled mode](../../docs/guides/controlled-and-uncontrolled-modes.md). You can use this mode to persist, and restore the Grid's state and share it in other parts of the application.

This demo uses the `DataTypeProvider` plugin to display custom data types. See [Data Formatting](../../docs/guides/data-formatting.md)
