### BREAKING CHANGES

* **react-grid:** We moved layout templates from the TableView plugin to the Grid component. The Grid component with the predefined plugins is nowÂ available in the "@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3" package. If you want to define custom layout templates, the Grid component without predefined templates is still available in the "devexpress/dx-react-grid" package.

  The following code:

  ```jsx
  import {
    Grid
  } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid';
  ```

  should be replaced with:

  ```jsx
  import {
    Grid
  } from '@devexpress/dx-react-grid-bootstrap3';
  ```

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Previously, to enable the 'Detail row' feature a user had to use only the 'TableRowDetail' plugin. But, this plugin mixed up the rendering and state managing functionality. Now, there are two particular plugins. The first one is the 'RowDetailState' plugin. It's responsible for a state managing. The second one is the 'TableRowDetail' plugin. It only renders a detail row.

  The following code:

  ```jsx
  <TableRowDetail
    expandedRows={expandedRows}
    onExpandedRowsChange={onExpandedRowsChange}
    template={({ row }) =>
      <GridDetailContainer
        data={row}
        columns={detailColumns}
      />
    }
  />
  ```

  should be replaced with:

  ```jsx
  <RowDetailState
    expandedRows={expandedRows}
    onExpandedRowsChange={onExpandedRowsChange}
  />
  <TableRowDetail
    template={({ row }) =>
      <GridDetailContainer
        data={row}
        columns={detailColumns}
      />
    }
  />
  ```
