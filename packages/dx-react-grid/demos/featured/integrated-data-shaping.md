# React Grid Integrated Data Shaping

This demo shows how to use TypeScript to create a Grid with sorting, grouping, filtering, and paging.

If you use selection with integrated data shaping, the way the Select All checkbox works depends on the plugin order. In this demo, the `IntegratedSelection` plugin is linked after all the data shaping plugins. In this case, Select All affects only displayed rows.
