# Vue Grid Vuex Integration

In this demo, the [Vuex store](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/getting-started.html) manages the Grid's state. All end-user actions that modify the component state produce corresponding [Vuex mutations](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/mutations.html) that the Grid commits. You can perform time-travelling and observe the Grid's state changes with the [Vue DevTool Extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) that is activated in this demo.
