## Contributing Code and Content

Important: **Read Section 5 of the [LICENSE AGREEMENT](LICENSE.md#5-submission-of-contributions) before submitting any contribution.**

Please keep in mind that DevExtreme Reactive has a development schedule; we are unable to accept every pull request from non-DevExpress contributors.

However, you are welcome to fork the repository, modify the source code in your fork, and make your builds.

To submit a pull request, follow these guidelines:

1. Describe all applied changes in detail
2. Make sure that all [automatic checks](README_DEVELOPERS.md#tests-and-ci) pass
