# DevExtreme Reactive &middot; [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive) [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@devexpress/dx-core.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devexpress/dx-core)

DevExtreme Reactive is a set of business React components that deeply integrate with Bootstrap and Material-UI libraries.

## This project is not in development. We continue to support and fix bugs in it
We are currently investigating the possibility of making our [DevExtreme](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme) components [native](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/issues/16468). They will replace DevExtreme Reactive components. To create a new application, use [devextreme react](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-react). We are now working on migration guides for those who already have applications based on Reactive to make the migration easier.

## Common Features

- Composable and extendable plugin-based architecture
- 100% Native React (no jQuery or other dependencies)
- High performance by using React best practicies
- [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) integration with seamless theming
- Controlled (stateless) and uncontrolled (stateful) modes
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/) integration with state persistence and time-traveling
