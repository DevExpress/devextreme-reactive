# React Scheduler Remote Data Binding

This demo shows how to bind the Scheduler to a remote data source. Handle the Scheduler's state to perform a parametrized HTTP request to a web server and update the Scheduler data each time the state changes. The demo also shows how to display a custom loading indicator while a request is being processed.
