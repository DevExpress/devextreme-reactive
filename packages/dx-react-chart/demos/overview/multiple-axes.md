# React Chart Overview

The DevExtreme React Chart is a component that visualizes data using different series types including bar, line, area, scatter, pie, and others. It has additional elements such as axes, a legend, a grid and a title. You can easily create a custom series type, add one or more axes, group series in stacks, and more. Explore our demos to find the chart for your project.
