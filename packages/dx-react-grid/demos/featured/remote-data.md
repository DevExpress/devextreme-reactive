# React Grid Remote Data Binding

This demo shows how to bind the Grid to a remote data source. To perform a parametrized HTTP request to a web-service, handle
Grid state change events to obtain the current grid state and create a query using the obtained state. This query should be correctly recognized by the data
service. You can display your own loading indicator during request processing.
