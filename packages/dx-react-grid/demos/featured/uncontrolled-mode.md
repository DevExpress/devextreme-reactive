# React Grid Uncontrolled State Mode

This demo demonstrates the use of the Grid in the [Uncontrolled State mode](/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/controlled-and-uncontrolled-modes/). That is, the Grid mananges its state internally. Use this mode if you do not need to share the Grid's state among other parts of your application.
