# React Chart - Animation

You can use the [Animation](../reference/animation.md) plugin to animate Chart series at the beginning of the lifetime.

## Basic Setup

Add the `Animation` plugin to the Chart component and all series will be animated out of the box. Also you can customize base animation options, like duration for each bar, as demonstrated in the following example:

.embedded-demo({ "path": "chart-basic/animation", "showThemeSelector": true })
