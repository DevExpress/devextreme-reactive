# React Scheduler Integrated Data Shaping

This demo shows how to use TypeScript to create a `Scheduler` with [date navigation](../../docs/guides/date-navigation.md) and [view switching](../../docs/guides/view-switching.md) in the `Uncontrolled mode`. Use this mode if you do not need to share the `Scheduler`’s state among other parts of your application.
